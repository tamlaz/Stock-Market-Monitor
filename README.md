# Stock-Market-Analyzer

# The goal of the project is to monitor and analyze stocks that are traded on the main US based stock-exhanges. Users can experience trading without investing real money, and they are able to gather information about tickers they are interested in. The application uses BootStrap and custom CSS in order to provide smooth and easy-to-use user experience.
# My long term objective is to perform comprehensive validation on tickers putting my previous financial analyst experience to use.
# The project was built using Java/Spring as backend, Angular framework as frontend and MySQL as RDBMS.
# JWT is used for user authentication.
# Third party APIs are used to access real-time and historical data about tickers. The application sends multiple requests to Polygon API when a new ticker is listed to gather historical data and download images and icons. FinnHub API is called in every 60 seconds, when the application refreshes latest stock-prices.
